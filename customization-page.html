                  <h2>Wood</h2>
                  <p class="margin-bottom">Wood is one of the most popular furniture materials. It has been the leading material in furniture manufacturing for ages. Anything from storage units to bed and tables has been made of wood for centuries, making its integration into the interior simple as ABC. While it is widely used, it is generally a higher-priced material than most of the options available. And hence, it is preferred only when the furniture is expected to be used in the long term.</p>                
                </div>
                <div class="item-custom s-12 m-12 l-4 margin-m-bottom">
                  <a class="image-hover-zoom margin-bottom"><img src="img/material/material2.png" alt=""></a>
                  <h2>Wicker / Cane</h2>
                  <p class="margin-bottom">Wicker / Cane is another material type that has been used for long enough now. It has become relatively less common today. However, plenty of light and stylish furniture solutions made of cane are still available. Though, the thing to keep in mind is it needs a matching decor to go within the interior space. Though it brings new beauty to the home, it is not entirely durable, and high maintenance is required to upkeep this.</p>                 
                </div>
                <div class="item-custom s-12 m-12 l-4 margin-m-bottom">
                  <a class="image-hover-zoom margin-bottom"><img src="img/material/material3.png" alt=""></a>
                  <h2>Steel</h2>
                  <p class="margin-bottom">Stainless Steel and other materials of the kind like chrome and metal are dominant in modern, hi-tech interior space solutions. Like glass, some furniture will be made of Steel exclusively. In contrast, most of them can have metal inserts for strength with other materials in both functional and decorative pieces. While it brings power without adding much of a weight, it does not give a classic look. Hence, it is not much preferred in general.</p>                 
                </div>
                <div class="item-custom s-12 m-12 l-4 margin-m-bottom">
                  <a class="image-hover-zoom margin-bottom"><img src="img/material/mdf.png" alt=""></a>
                  <h2>MDF / Plywood</h2>
                  <p class="margin-bottom">MDF/Plywood is a cost-friendly solution for the modern home decors. It provides the basic look like wood, but it is a low budget option with lesser durability. Nevertheless, with recent trends of regular revamping the homes, it has definitely become one of the dominant materials in the current furniture market.
                    Another variant of stylish MDF furniture is to cover it with a polished and thick lacquer finish. The furniture will look bright and elegant. They combine style and simplicity, making the most suitable modern interiors solution.</p>                 
                </div>
                <div class="item-custom s-12 m-12 l-4 margin-m-bottom">
                  <a class="image-hover-zoom margin-bottom" ><img src="img/material/fabric.png" alt=""></a>
                  <h2>Fabric</h2>
                  <p class="margin-bottom">Fabric is undoubtedly a softer and mild material used for the upholstery in a piece of furniture. Mostly fabric is a part of delicacy in furniture meant for seating arrangements like a chair, sofa, stool, ottoman, etc. Unlike leather, it comes in a range of prices depending on the quality and texture of the fabric.
                    So we got the basics of the commonly accessible and popular furniture materials covered.
                    The interesting fact is that some of them are used alone to make the furniture at times. But more often, a combination of these is preferred to make a perfect looking durable and robust piece of furniture</p>                 
                </div>
                <div class="item-custom s-12 m-12 l-4 margin-m-bottom">
                  <a class="image-hover-zoom margin-bottom" ><img src="img/material/glass.png" alt=""></a>
                  <h2>Glass</h2>
                  <p class="margin-bottom">Tempered glass is a modern approach to interior decoration options. There are a few types of furniture made of glass exclusively. Yet, plenty of tables, storage units, and even computer desks may be made of a combination of materials featuring glass as the primary material. While glass can add elegance and class to the furniture, it is fragile than most of the materials and risky to use.</p>

                  <h2>Chevron</h2>
                  <p class="margin-bottom">Chevron is a fun pattern made up of zigzag stripes. The stripes are often made of two contrasting, alternating colors like white and bright red. It is a versatile pattern that works with a range of styles, from traditional to modern, and its sharp, geometric lines provide a great contrast to more organic patterns. Try decorating your outdoor seating area with chevron throw pillows to add some lively fun.</p>                
                </div>
                <div class="item-custom s-12 m-12 l-4 margin-m-bottom">

                  <h2>Striped</h2>
                  <p class="margin-bottom">The striped pattern is one of the most basic decor elements, consisting of long, parallel stripes. Some striped patterns include stripes of the same width, while others incorporate stripes of differing widths to add visual interest. Stripes look great in any home and pair well with different patterns. Try upholstering your kitchen nook with a striped fabric and accenting the space with throw pillows of a different pattern.</p>                 
                </div>
                <div class="item-custom s-12 m-12 l-4 margin-m-bottom">
                  <a class="image-hover-zoom margin-bottom"><img src="img/patterns/plaid.jpeg" alt=""></a>
                  <h2>Plaid & Checkered</h2>
                  <p class="margin-bottom">Plaid is a common pattern consisting of overlapping horizontal and vertical stripes. These stripes form a distinctive checked pattern, usually punctuated with thin stripes in a bright color. Plaid works well in a rustic, traditional, or country-cottage home. For instance, try plaid valances above your kitchen windows to add some cheer to the space.

                    Checkered patterns consist of side-by-side squares in alternating colors, creating a simple yet striking effect. Like plaid, checkered fabric works well with many styles, particularly country-cottage, rustic, and transitional homes. For a mix of both styles, try a gingham tablecloth to transport you and your family to an Italian bistro for dinner!</p>

                  <h2>Paisley</h2>
                  <p class="margin-bottom">The paisley pattern consists of embellished, floral teardrop shapes, usually in springlike colors. Paisley can make a big difference in your decor – try a neutral paisley pattern to add texture to a contemporary living room, or a bold paisley shower curtain to add character to a bathroom.</p>

                  <h2>Damask</h2>
                  <p class="margin-bottom">Damask is a thick woven fabric with a repeating floral pattern visible on both sides. Damask originated in China and has long been viewed as a luxury fabric. While technically not a pattern, damask-style patterns can be printed onto fabric or wallpaper for an affordable alternative to woven damask. Damask fabric is typically traditional in style, but modern updates with bright colors can work well in a transitional or contemporary home. An example of damask’s versatility is damask wallpaper, which makes an elegant statement in homes of both styles.</p>                 
                </div>
                <div class="item-custom s-12 m-12 l-4 margin-m-bottom">
                  <a class="image-hover-zoom margin-bottom"><img src="img/patterns/floral.jpeg" alt=""></a>
                  <h2>Floral</h2>
                  <p class="margin-bottom">Floral patterns vary greatly in style – from monochromatic to colorful, and from repeated patterns to abstract designs. Whatever your style is, you will likely find a floral pattern to match your home. Most floral patterns fit easily into traditional and country-cottage styles, but can also be used to introduce texture and pops of color to contemporary homes. Try floral curtains in your bedroom to brighten and feminize the space.</p>
